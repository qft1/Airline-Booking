## Short Description
This project is a travel (airline booking) web application developed using PHP and MySQL.  
The system allows users to:
- Register by creating a personal account
- Log in securely using their username and password
- Continue browsing as a guest

User authentication is handled on the server side using PHP sessions, and all user information is stored in a MySQL database.  
The application includes an admin panel that enables administrators to view all registered users and delete user accounts when needed.  
All data input is collected through HTML forms and validated on the server side to ensure required fields, valid email formats, and minimum password length.  

This project demonstrates:
- Core CRUD operations
- Database connectivity
- Server-side form handling
- Basic security practices within a travel booking context

## Required Environment
